JAVA PROJECT

java 1.7
maven 3
git

DL the JDK7 => http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html (that should make the coffee)

be a lil lazy linuxboy do apt-get and install couchdb maven and git
get eclipse (J2EE version) => https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/luna/R/eclipse-jee-luna-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz&mirror_id=514

once on eclipse, import the project (file/import... then search and choose 'dynamic web module') 

ASK me or duckduckgo if you need any help!

on git don't push target (they are complied files so they are useless, u can't work on them they are already finished product)
